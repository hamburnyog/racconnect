## üìã Executive Summary

Hold onto your coffee mugs because we've just turbocharged the RACConnect app! This release is all about making sure your hard work gets the recognition it deserves with accurate DTR calculations. Say goodbye to incorrect undertime/late markings - we've got your back (and your lunch break too)!

## üöÄ Key Improvements

### 1. Math Class Graduate üéì
- Fixed those pesky undertime/late calculations that were acting like they failed basic math
- Now properly counts your lunch breaks (because even robots need to eat!)
- Smart enough to know that one log or no logs = 8 hours undertime (no more ghost hours!)

### 2. Profile Power-Up üí™
- Locked away your passwords in Fort Knox-level security storage
- Added fancy biometric login so you can feel like a secret agent
- Refreshed profiles faster than you can say "updated!"

### 3. Export Awesomeness üìÑ
- COS employees rejoice! Now you can export both Annex A and Accomplishment Reports
- Choose your adventure: First Half, Second Half, or Whole Month exports
- PDFs so pretty, you'll want to frame them (okay, maybe not)

### 4. UI That Doesn't Judge You üòä
- Added cool green glow effects for days you've conquered attendance
- Made everything look shinier and more clickable than before
- Error messages that actually help instead of confusing you

## üìÅ What We Actually Changed

### Android Settings
We told Kotlin to grow up and updated it from an old teenager to a responsible adult version.

### Data Models
- Gave the Accomplishment model a makeover (changed field names to make more sense)
- Taught Attendance model about accomplishments (they're now BFFs)

### Data Repositories
Rewrote everything from scratch because the old stuff was giving us trust issues:
- Accomplishment repo now talks properly to the database
- Attendance repo got smarter with new helper methods
- Auth repo learned to fetch more profile details
- Profile repo got a facelift too

### Business Logic (Cubits)
- Attendance cubit now plays nice with accomplishments
- Auth cubit got a refresh button (metaphorically speaking)

### UI Pages
- **Attendance Page**: Got a glow-up with visual indicators and better export buttons
- **Employee View Page**: Now has tabs so you can switch between info like a pro
- **Personnel Page**: Smarter filtering so you only see who you should see
- **Export Button**: Brand new component that handles PDF magic

### Utility Functions
- Excel helpers learned how to properly write supervisor names
- Generate Excel became a math genius and finally understands lunch breaks

## üîß The Nerdy Stuff (But In Simple Terms)

### 1. Work Hour Calculation Magic

**What Was Wrong Before:**
- The system was like that friend who can't split a bill - terrible at math
- Lunch breaks were being ignored like they didn't exist
- One log or no logs? System went "I dunno" and gave random numbers

**What We Fixed:**
- Now it counts 8 hours workdays properly (finally!)
- Makes sure your lunch break is actually between 12 PM - 1 PM (no more "I ate lunch at 3 AM" nonsense)
- Smart enough to know that missing logs = 8 hours undertime (because that's how reality works)

### 2. Profile Security Boost

**Level Up Achieved:**
- Passwords now live in a digital vault (much safer than under your keyboard)
- Added biometric login so you can unlock the app with your fingerprint (hello, James Bond)
- Profiles now auto-refresh so everything stays up-to-date

### 3. Export Superpowers

**COS Employee Special Features:**
- Two-for-one export deal (Annex A AND Accomplishment Reports)
- Pick your period like choosing your own adventure book
- PDFs so professional, they practically sign themselves

**Everyone Else Gets:**
- Same awesome export functionality but without the COS extras
- Pretty documents that make HR smile (we think)

## üîí Security Improvements

### Digital Fort Knox
- Stashed passwords somewhere hackers can't find them
- Added biometric locks so only you (or someone with your finger) can access
- Made sure only the right people can export sensitive reports

---

## üé® UI/UX Makeover

### Paint Job and Interior Design
- Added sparkly green effects for completed attendance days (so satisfying!)
- Made everything look more modern than your grandma's kitchen
- Buttons that actually respond when you poke them (responsive design FTW!)

### Speed Demon Mode
- Pages load faster than you can say "loading..."
- Less waiting, more doing
- Smooth scrolling that feels like butter (digital butter, obviously)

---

## üß™ Quality Control

### We Didn't Just Wing It
- Tested calculations with more scenarios than a math textbook
- Made sure exports work on phones, tablets, and computers
- Verified that COS employees get their special treatment

### Real World Testing
- Checked that everything works when the internet decides to take a nap
- Made sure huge amounts of data don't crash the app
- Confirmed that edge cases don't turn into actual sharp objects

---

## üìà Why This Matters

### Happy Employees = Happy Life
- No more "I worked 8 hours but it says I'm late" panic attacks
- Payroll gets accurate information (your wallet will thank you)
- Less time spent by HR fixing mistakes = more time for coffee breaks

### Boss Level Achievement
- Compliance with government DTR requirements (no more angry letters)
- Audit trails that don't make accountants cry
- Professional reports that make upper management nod approvingly

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Notes

### Before You Hit That Deploy Button
1. Back up your data (just in case things go sideways)
2. Make sure everyone's profiles are complete (no blank spots)
3. Test with a few users before unleashing on everyone

### After Deployment Party
- Check that calculations look right with real data
- Make sure COS employees can export their special reports
- Verify that managers can only see their team members

## üÜò Known Quirks

### Nothing's Perfect (But We Tried)
- Biometric login only works on devices that have fancy fingerprint scanners
- Huge datasets might make the app think for a sec (give it a moment)
- Some older phones might need a gentle reminder to update
